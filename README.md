## 2. Brief description of the CSS Framework:

Our team is developing a custom CSS framework using Sass and Sass partials to provide a structured, customizable, and reusable design system for styling web applications. This framework will include predefined styles for essential HTML elements and utility classes to ensure consistency, scalability, and ease of use.

## 3. Installation

- To use this framework, you need Node.js and npm installed. If you haven't installed them yet, you can download and install them from the following links: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- After installing the dependencies, you need to compile the Sass files into CSS.

## 4. Usage

- Link the CSS File to Your HTML.
- Using Utility Classes in Your HTML like, Adding Shadows to Elements, Customizing Text Styles, Spacing etc...

## 5. Customization instructions

You can easily customize the framework to suit your design needs by modifying the variables defined in the \_variables.scss file. This allows you to adjust the colors, font sizes, spacing, and more. Example: Changing Primary Color in _variables.scss -  $primary-color: #ff5733; // Change to your desired color. After making changes, recompile your Sass files to apply updates. This will generate an updated CSS file reflecting your custom styles. By following these steps, you can quickly integrate and customize the framework for your projects.
